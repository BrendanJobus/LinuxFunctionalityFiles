CISC - Intel & AMD
RISC - ARM & RISC-V

RISC - Reduced Instruction Set Computer
CISC - Complex

RISC:
Load/store architectures - explicitly load data from memory and store results
Large code size
Large number of general purpose registers

CISC:
Complex and a large number of instructions that access memory directly
Small number of general purpose registers
Complex instruction decoding hardware
Internally, CISC instructions are broken down into small micro-operations which are executed in a singl cycle, sometimes even in parallel
Intel has a RISC core to execute simple instructions in one clock cycle, these are the calls which are most common
