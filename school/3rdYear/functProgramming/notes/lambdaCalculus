Syntax:
Infinite set Vars, of variables:
	u,v,x,y,z,...,x1,x2,... E Vars

Well-formed lambda calculus expressions LExpr is the smallest set of strings matching the following syntax:

	M,N,... E LExpr ::= v
			| (lambdax . M)
			| (M N)

A variable occurrence is free in an expression if it is not mentioned in an enclosing abstractoin.
e.g. x (lambda y . (yz))
z is free

A variable occurrence is bound in an expression if it is mentioned in an enclosing abstraction.
e.g. x (lambda y . (yz))
y is bound

A variable can be both free and bound in the same expression.
e.g. (x(lambda x.(xy))
The first x is free and the second is bound

A bound variable is like a local variable, where as a free is global.
