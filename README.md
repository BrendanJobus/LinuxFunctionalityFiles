Backup for reinstalling my linux installation.

### NOTE ###
This is not a full install and does not include scripts for the installation of required programs to run this setup or get full functionality, it is simply the majority of scripts and various configuration files that gives my machine its functionality. It also includes a few files that are presonal but not sensitive, such as a few small learning programs I wrote and wallpapers. An installation script may be added later, but currently it is not included. The awesome setup is taken from [the-glorious-dotfiles by manilarome](https://github.com/manilarome/the-glorious-dotfiles).
